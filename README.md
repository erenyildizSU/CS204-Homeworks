# CS204 – Advanced Programming (Spring 2024)

This repository contains my personal solutions to all six assignments of the CS204 course at Sabancı University. The assignments cover a wide range of advanced C++ topics, including dynamic memory management, linked data structures, object-oriented programming, operator overloading, game simulation, and multithreading with synchronization.

---

## 🧠 Overview of Topics

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
- Object-Oriented Design and Encapsulation
- Operator Overloading in C++
- Stack Structures and Undo Mechanism
- Multithreading & Mutex Synchronization
- Game Logic Simulation

## 📂 Homework Summaries

### 📝 Homework 1 – Dynamic Memory & File Parsing
Reads and tokenizes a structured file containing subject-verb-object statements. Focused on using dynamic memory, string parsing, and basic memory debugging.

### 🔗 Homework 2 – Matching Pairs with Linked Lists
Implements a matching system using two separate singly linked lists (`likes` and `taken`). Establishes mutual relationships and applies specific list operations to match or discard connections dynamically.

### 🧑‍💼 Homework 3 – Hybrid 2D Linked List for Employee-Project Tracking
Develops a two-dimensional hybrid linked list to manage employee-project assignments, with a stack structure to support undo operations. Involves sorted insertion by names and priorities.

### 🧬 Homework 4 – DNA Sequence Class with Operator Overloading
Implements a DNA sequence class (`DNAseq`) using enums and dynamic arrays. Overloads multiple operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `!`, `<=`, etc.) to simulate real genetic operations such as concatenation, mutation, and complementation.

### 🎮 Homework 5 – Rotated Connect-N Game
Simulates a modified Connect-4 game where players can either drop a piece or rotate the board. Focuses on OOP, board state management, and encapsulated game logic across `Board` and `Player` classes.

### 🔄 Homework 6 – Multithreaded Guessing Game
Implements a multithreaded “Guess the Number” game using C++ threads and mutexes. The game simulates a host and multiple players guessing numbers in parallel with proper synchronization and fairness handling.
